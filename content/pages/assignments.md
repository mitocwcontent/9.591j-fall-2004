Term Project/Paper

Students will produce a final project/paper, due three days after Lecture 12. If this is a paper, it should be roughly 10-20 pages. This paper can be on any topic in sentence processing. This paper may consist of novel proposals, analysis and data, or alternatively it may consist of a review article in a specified area, with evaluation and commentary.
